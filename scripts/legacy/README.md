# Legacy Scripts (Cyqle1 era)

These scripts reference the original project name "CyQle1" and expect a
`JUCE_ROOT` environment variable. The real UltraGlitch build uses CMake
FetchContent (JUCE 8.0.3) and does **not** need pre-installed JUCE.

These files are kept for historical reference only. Do **not** use them
for building UltraGlitch BitFucker.

See the top-level `BUILD.md` and `scripts/build_windows.ps1` for current
build instructions.
